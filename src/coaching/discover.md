keySkills:
  - "Build a discovery & design process that works"
  - "Turn learning into a competitive advantage"
  - "Diffuse insights across the wider business"
programmeDescription:
  - "This programme lays the foundation for continuous product improvement and long-term success."
  - "Many products fail because of an over-confidence in the value of our ideas and a bias towards measuring productivity rather than outcomes. The result is invariably a product that grows in functionality and complexity, but without the business growth to justify the energy and hard work, or the learning needed for long-term success."
  - "Discovery is a continuous set of customer-focussed activities that addresses all this, to increase the likelihood that the time, money and energy invested in product development generates a positive return. On top of that, these activities also help uncover a constant stream of new opportunities, while building a treasure trove of customer insights to help capitalise on them."
  - "In short, product discovery brings teams closer to customers, uncovers new opportunities, increases the likelihood of business results and builds a competitive advantage your competition can't copy."
programmeOutcomes:
  - "Teams are able to generate more, higher quality ideas"
  - "Team members feel safer and more confident to voice their opinions"
programmeActivities:
  - title: "Make space for discovery"
    description: "Product teams should be continually engaged in two activities - working out what to build (discovery) and building it (development). Undoubtedly your team's prioritised development, so together we'll work out how best make space for discovery."
