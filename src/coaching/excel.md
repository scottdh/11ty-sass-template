programmeDescription:
  - "This programmes' focus is to help teams successfully harness their diverse skills, expertise and perspectives while collaborating, so that they can reliably push their ideas beyond the obvious, to the innovative."
  - "Humans are hardwired for harmonious cooperation, not creative collaboration. The former’s useful for fitting in and maintaining the status quo, but it’s the latter that drives high-performance teams, break-through ideas and business growth."
  - "To this end, I'll work with teams to develop the skills and frameworks they'll need to tap into their diverse perspectives and experiences as effectively as possible. Mixing, melding and multiplying each others' ideas into new and better alternatives. To achieve this though, we'll have to overcome behaviours that run against high-performance, such as group-think,  "
programmeOutcomes:
  - "Teams are able to generate higher quality ideas and solutions by better leveraging their diverse skills and perspectives."
  - "Team members feel safer and more confident to voice alternative opinions or try new things."
  - "Members can encourage and facilitate healthy debate, harnessing the power of conflicting ideas to drive innovation and propel the team forward."
