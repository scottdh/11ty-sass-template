programmeDescription:
  - "This programme focusses on helping teams successfully harness their diverse skills, expertise and perspectives, so that they can reliably push their ideas beyond the obvious, to the innovative."
  - "Humans are hardwired for harmonious cooperation, not creative collaboration. While the former’s useful for maintaining order, it’s the latter that drives high-performance teams, break-through ideas and business growth."
  - "To this end, I'll work with teams to develop the skills and tools needed to tap into their diverse ideas, perspectives and experiences as effectively as possible. Unlocking their full collective potential."
  - "We'll look at how to create fearless teams, where every member feels confident to voice their unique ideas and perspectives, respectfully challenge others', try new things and admit mistakes. We'll develop tailored principles to guide collaborative efforts, so time spent tackling hard challenges together is as engaging, inclusive and effective as possible."
  - "In short, we'll build fulfilled teams that trust each other, bring out the best in each other and push each others' ideas further. All in the pursuit of higher quality solutions, continuous improvement and products that deliver ever-increasing value for both customers and your business."

  - "Teams are able to generate higher quality ideas and solutions by better leveraging their diverse skills and perspectives."
  - "Team members feel safer and more confident to voice alternative opinions or try new things."
  - "Teams experience greater engagement, leading to greater job satisfaction and performance."
