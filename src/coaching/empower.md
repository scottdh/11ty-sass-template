summary: "Unlock your teams' ability to make better decisions, move faster and ship more value to customers sooner."
programmeDescription:
  - 'The vast majority of product companies leverage just a fraction of what the talented people they employ are capable of. This programme aims to change that, by helping leaders and teams develop the tools, language and shared principles they need to move away from limiting "dictate and deliver" approaches, to one of limitless potential - "collaborate and empower".'
  - "Your product company's best, most valuable ideas will never come from customers or leaders. They come from cross-functional product teams that deeply understand their customers, their product, the technology that drives it, and their business. "
  - "The key to unlocking this potential is to shift away from seeing this team as one that simply build features in service of the busines and instead, a lean, mean learning machine that serves customers in ways that reliably grow their business."
programmeOutcomes:
  - "A visual map of your product and how well itâ€™s performing in key areas, to better support strategic conversations between teams and stakeholders"
  - "A more focussed approach to documenting customer insights and product improvement ideas, to fuel better discovery, and build a long-term competitive advantage."
  - "Leadership and teams can readily identify target opportunities and outcomes that will bring real business value, rather than simple outputs to be delivered."
  - "An agreed way of working that empowers teams to learn and work as they see fit to deliver on the negotiated outcomes, while keeping stakeholders in the loop the entire way."
  - "The team is working more transparently which inspires trust between them and their stakeholders"
