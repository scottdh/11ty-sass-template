programmeDescription:
  - "The focus of this programme is to dig into your business' current challenges and lay the foundation for empowered, high-performing teams."
  - "Empowered teams form the backbone of today's most successful product organisations. These teams, unlike most, aren't limited to delivering a prescribed list of unproven features, sprint after sprint. Instead, they're given a strategic objective to achieve and the autonomy to pursue it as they see fit. Which they do by making fast, informed decisions based on real-time data and learning."
  - "This freedom, combined with a relentless focus on customer needs and a shared responsibility for delivering results is the key to high-performance. <em>Enabling empowered teams to build not just the next thing on the list, but an understanding of customers and what it takes to build products that succeed</em>."
  - "Together, we'll develop the environment and skills needed to successfully empower and lead your own teams. We'll break down your products' current challenges in ways that everyone can understand and contribute to solving. And we'll look at how to define and assign objectives teams can own, so that they can begin quickly and transparently tackling your business' top priorities, in new and more effective ways."
