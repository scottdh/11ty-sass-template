summary: "Unlock your teams' ability to make decisions, move fast and ship value to customers sooner."
programmeDescription:
  - "This programme lays the foundation for effective product leadership and high-performing teams."
  - "The vast majority of product companies leverage just a fraction of what the talented people they employ are capable of, with top-down, 'backlog driven' approaches to decision-making that bypass so many of the skills and talents of their teams."
  - "Not only does this lead to reduced team engagement, it limits teams' ability to learn, innovate and deliver effective solutions that grow the business quickly."
  - "The answer?"
  - "Empowered, self-driven product teams, combined with an outcome-driven approach to leadership. When teams are given the autonomy to improve the lives of customers they've got to know first-hand, with solutions they've devised and developed themselves to achieve negotiated outcomes, incredible things happen. Motivation, creativity and team effectiveness skyrocket. Along with the success of their product and business."
  - "There's just one catch though. To empower teams successfully, shared-understanding of the business' goals, as well as effective, continuous two-way communication between leaders and teams at a strategic level is crucial. But is so rarely the case. This is exactly what I'll help you address. And in doing so, we'll also bring clarity to your product's biggest opportunities and priorities, from which we can move forward with greater trust and speed."

programmeOutcomes:
  - "A visual map of your product and how well itâ€™s performing in key areas, to better support strategic conversations between teams and stakeholders"
  - "Leadership and teams can readily identify target opportunities and outcomes that will bring real business value, rather than simply outputs to be delivered."
  - "An agreed way of planning and working that empowers teams to learn and work as they see fit to deliver on negotiated outcomes."
  - "Leaders and other stakeholders feel kept in the loop, able to make decisions, without resorting to dictating to teams."
  - "A more focussed approach to documenting customer insights and product improvement ideas, to fuel better discovery, and build a long-term competitive advantage."
  - "Product team members feel more engaged and motivated with directly impact their daily work and customers' lives."
