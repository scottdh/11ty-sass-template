summary: "Unlock your teams' ability to make better decisions, move faster and ship more value to customers sooner."
programmeDescription:
  - "<strong>In this coaching programme, we'll dig into your business' current challenges and lay the foundation for empowered, high-performing teams.</strong>"
  - "To survive in volatile market conditions where tech, customer expectations and competition evolve at pace, continuous learning and speed are crucial. This is why empowered, self-driven product teams form the backbone of today's most successful tech organisations."
  - "These teams aren't simply handed an ever-lengthening list of unproven features to estimate and build, sprint after sprint. Such a 'command and control' approach not only leverages just a fraction of what teams are capable of, leading to reduced engagement, but it actively thwarts long term success. This is because it robs them of the opportunity to learn, adapt and innovate."
  - "Instead, empowered teams are more like special forces units or competitive sports teams. They're given a strategic objective and trusted to use their diverse skills and talents to learn from customers, act and adapt fast.... and get the job done. Each time, improving their own understanding of customers and what it takes to succeed, by serving them in ways that grow the business."
  - "In short, they're responsible for results, not just code. And this changes everything. Creating an environment primed for learning, continuous improvement, speed and innovation."
