summary: "Unlock your teams' ability to make better decisions, move faster and ship more value to customers sooner."
programmeDescription:
  - "The focus of this programme is to dig into your business' current challenges and lay the foundation for empowered, high-performing teams."
  - "Empowered teams form the backbone of today's most successful product organisations. Unlike most, these teams aren't simply handed an ever-lengthening list of unproven features to estimate, design and build, sprint after sprint. Instead, they're more like a special forces unit. They're given a strategic objective to achieve and the autonomy to pursue it as they see fit, by making fast, informed decisions based on real-time learning."
  - "This means they're responsible not only for designs and code, but results too. <strong>And this changes everything</strong>."
  - "It changes how leaders lead, driving innovation, not hampering it with micro-management. It changes how teams work, contributing to long-term success, not just the next thing on the list. And it changes the culture, from one that optimises for what's easily measured such as productivity and output, to one that optimises for what matters -  continuous learning and improvement, agility and results."
  - "<h4>Our challenge</h4>"
programmeOutcomes:
  - "A visual map of your product and how well itâ€™s performing in key areas, to better support strategic conversations between teams and stakeholders"
  - "Leadership and teams can readily identify target opportunities and outcomes that will bring real business value, rather than simply outputs to be delivered."
  - "An agreed way of planning and working that empowers teams to learn and work as they see fit to deliver on negotiated outcomes."
  - "Leaders and other stakeholders feel kept in the loop, able to make decisions, without resorting to dictating to teams."
  - "A more focussed approach to documenting customer insights and product improvement ideas, to fuel better discovery, and build a long-term competitive advantage."
  - "Product team members feel more engaged and motivated with directly impact their daily work and customers' lives."
