summary: "Unlock your teams' ability to make better decisions, move faster and ship more value to customers sooner."
programmeDescription:
  - "Your most valuable ideas, most likely to please customers and grow your business will come from a cross-functional product that knows their customers, their product and their business intimately."
  - "The key to unlocking this potential is to shift away from seeing this team as a group that build features and instead a team that affect outcomes through intense, iterative customer-focused learning."
programmeOutcomes:
  - "A visualised map of your product and how itâ€™s performing for your customers which will build shared understanding and contribute value to conversation about strategy."
  - "A more focussed approach to documenting customer feedback, insights and product improvement ideas, to fuel design and discovery and build a competitive advantage."
  - "Leadership and teams are able to identify and negotiate business and product outcomes that will bring real business value, rather than simply dictating outputs to be delivered."
  - "An agreed way of working that empowers teams to learn and work as they see fit to deliver on the negotiated outcomes while keeping stakeholders in the loop the entire way."
  - "The team is working more transparently which inspires trust between them and their stakeholders"
