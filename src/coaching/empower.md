summary: "Unlock your teams' ability to make better decisions, move faster and ship more value to customers sooner."
programmeDescription:
  - "This programme lays the foundation for effective product leadership and high-performing teams."
  - "The vast majority of product companies leverage just a fraction of what the talented people they employ are capable of, with top-down, 'backlog driven' approaches to decision-making that bypass so many of the skills and talents of their teams. Not only does this lead to reduced team engagement, it limits teams' ability to learn, innovate and deliver effective solutions that grow the business quickly."
  - "The answer?"
  - "Empowered, self-driven product teams. When teams are given the autonomy to improve the lives of customers they've got to know first-hand, with solutions they've devised and developed themselves, incredible things happen. Motivation, creativity and team effectiveness skyrocket. Along with the success of their product and business."
  - "To empower teams successfully however, shared-understanding of the business' goals, as well as effective two-way communication between leaders and teams at a strategic level is crucial. This is exactly what I'll help you address. And in doing so, we'll also bring a focusing degree of clarity to your product's biggest opportunities and priorities, from which we can move forward with greater trust, speed and confidence."

programmeOutcomes:
  - "A visual map of your product and how well itâ€™s performing in key areas, to better support strategic conversations between teams and stakeholders"
  - "A more focussed approach to documenting customer insights and product improvement ideas, to fuel better discovery, and build a long-term competitive advantage."
  - "Leadership and teams can readily identify target opportunities and outcomes that will bring real business value, rather than simple outputs to be delivered."
  - "An agreed way of working that empowers teams to learn and work as they see fit to deliver on the negotiated outcomes, while keeping stakeholders in the loop the entire way."
  - "The team is working more transparently which inspires trust between them and their stakeholders"
