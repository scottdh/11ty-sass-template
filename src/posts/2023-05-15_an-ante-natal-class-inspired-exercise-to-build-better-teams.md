> "High-performance doesn't exist without empathy and conflict between colleagues."

Last week I experienced my first ante-natal class. Hanging out with other soon-to-be parents, learning all about the final weeks of pregnancy and labour etc.

During this, the Mums and Dads-to-be were split into two groups and given a question. For the boys, we had “How can I best support my partner while they’re in labour”. The girls got “How can my partner best support me while I’m in labour”

It was a great exercise. It built empathy, trust and we learnt a lot. Not to mention team Dads nailed it, to the huge relief of our partners. Things like "pack snacks" and "play bouncer to family" got as much appreciation as "advocate for their wishes with medical staff" and "chant supportive messages (unless you're told to shut up)"

Why am I bringing this up?

Because it's a great exercise for you to do with your colleagues for exactly the same reasons. To empathise with each others' role and reveal ways to support each other better too. This explicit act of considering each others’ perspectives does wonders for conflict management. And you want constructive conflict. Not lots of polite people walking on egg shells.

Here's some classic pairings that should do this exercise:

- Designers and devs.
- Marketing and Sales.
- Chief Technology Officer and Head of Design
- Legal and Product
- Finance and Product

Basically, whoever you work closely with and often bump heads with. Or whoever you should be working closely with and bumping heads with.

Just split into two groups eg. design on one side and devs on another (try to keep equal numbers) and give this question to both:

**“How can I better support my (insert role) colleagues? How could they better support me?"**

Then start filling it with ideas. Give it a good 20 minutes. Long enough to get past the obvious stuff and 5-10 minutes into twiddling thumbs and clutching at straws territory.

Then come together to compare and contrast. Simple.

Try it and let me know how you get on.
