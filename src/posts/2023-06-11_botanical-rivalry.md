In the quaint English village of Lilliput, two garden centres stand locked in an epic rivalry. As summer looms on the horizon, the managers of these horticultural havens are determined to come up with this year's most profitable seller.

First, we have Mr. Taylor, who is utterly convinced that vases will be this year's summer hit.

It's obvious really. Just last week, his dear mum and sister, unbeknownst to each other, had both purchased vases for Aunt June's grand 70th birthday celebration. What's more, Mr. Taylor also happened to stumble upon a skilled potter in the pub one evening, who specialised in them. And if that combo wasn't serendipitous enough, he caught wind that the bigger city based competition were investing big in new vase collections too! The universe was clearly tapping him on the shoulder, whispering its encouragement.

With that, he commissioned some designs and set his plan in motion.

On the other side of this bitter rivalry, we have Ms. Johnson. The last two years hadn't gone her way, so she knew she had to try something different. This year, she put her own awesome sounding, but utterly unproven ideas to the side and tried something different.

She summoned her most trusted team members from the plant nursery, farm shop, marketing, and even finance, tasking them with a monumental challenge:

**"Surpass last year's summer best-seller profits by 20%!"**

A daunting endeavour. Yet, the team responded amazingly. The excited gleam in their eyes, matched only by the nervous trepidation in their hearts, showed how much they relished the opportunity to prove their mettle.

## The designs

Some time later, both Mr Taylor and Ms. Johnson get what they asked for, coincidentally in a very similar format.\*

Mr. Taylor, marvelled at the assortment of vase designs before him. A surge of confidence engulfed him. No doubt, one of these vases would fly off the shelves with such astonishing speed that Ms. Johnson's efforts would pale by comparison.

Ms. Johnson on the other hand didn't really know what to think when she saw what the team came back with. There were so many ideas! And some of them bonkers - VR garden goggles... really?!? Instead of blurting out her concerns, she smartly withheld them and started to ask questions instead.

When they started to explain their thinking behind their favourites... her doubts diffused and her belly filled with excitement and pride.

Beth, the farm shop sage, walked her through the idea that got the most votes.

It was a DIY home-grow seed kit with various customisable gift labels. She explained the team's steps and thought process:

1. Jamie from the café got more chatty with customers, asking about their gardens and hobbies and most recent memorable purchases or gifts. Here they got their first clue that people were appreciating more creative, 'hands-on' pastimes.
2. Joe from marketing saw similar while tracking cross-market trends, noticing a huge uplift in DIY and hobby kits since the pandemic.
3. Martha from finance knew most gift sales came from things close to point of sale, with items under £7 doing especially well, which gave them a constraint to narrow to.

What's more, they'd taken steps to test their idea already! Beth had a resourceful young cousin with a knack for Photoshop. A few packet designs were quickly crafted and printed on a humble home inkjet printer. Then folded and filled with seeds, ready for a little test in the shop.

Though this test lacked scalability and profitability, every single packet was snatched up at £5.99 a piece within a mere two hours! Fuelled by the knowledge that they could get production costs per item below 90p for the number they forecast to sell, they were in with a real chance of beating last years best-selling potted bonsai profits by at least 20%. This was thanks to one of Beth's farm shop partners that recently expanded control of their own supply chain by taking over a print works.

Ms. Johnson was truly flabbergasted... and humbled. This was so far away from the ideas she'd had herself. But so good! And it was amazing to see how the team had come together. She'd never seen them so animated.

Buoyed by the team's conviction, she granted the green light for negotiations with Beth's packaging and seed partners. Meanwhile, Mr. Taylor meticulously selected his favourite vase design for production.

Ready for the summer season frenzy, deliveries were made, displays meticulously arranged, and the stage was set. With anticipation filling the air, the two garden centres braced themselves for a clash of commerce and creativity like none other.

## The Result

And who won?

Mr Taylor took it by a whisker thanks to a surge in the final week!

Just as it looked like he was about to to be crushed by the well researched and validated plans of Ms. Johnson's team, his new found potter friend tragically died in a mis-firing kiln explosion. News spread all over local social media and people flocked to pick up a vase from the final collection of a lost local artisan. Boosting sales dramatically in the final week.

It was a crushing blow for Ms. Johnson's team. Despite them hitting their objective and smashing all previous records, the universe had conspired against them.

Ms. Johnson smiled upon their dejected looking faces before announcing "Shit happens. Get over it! You did amazingly well, exceeding all expectations and I couldn't be prouder."

And heres why:

1. Jamie's efforts in the café uncovered some great insights and ideas from our customers which highlighted new exciting opportunities for us to pursue.
2. Beth's instincts to test your idea were inspired. It meant you reduced the risk of pursuing an idea that would't work and we got some great feedback. We should do loads more of this. It'll likely mean we have to reduce how far we can plan ahead, so we can take what we learn into account but it'll be worth it.
3. We've started leveraging more of our collective skills, talents, knowledge and human connections which will surely pay dividends going forward.
4. I'm already getting CVs from some of the most ambitious botanical talent in the county, now they've got wind of the fact people here aren't just expected to do what they're told, but have agency and the opportunity experiment with their own ideas.

In short, I think our future's looking rosier than ever.

I for one reckon she's right.

\* _I'm slightly allergic to prioritisation frameworks that imply a greater degree of certainty or confidence in an idea than there really can be. It sets false expectations and often causes teams to pursue them longer than wise. I'm using this made-up confidence/cost framework to illustrate the point that Ms. Johnson's team is giving the business significantly more variety, not only in ideas but approaches to risk_.
