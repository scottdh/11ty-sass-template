          I've been designing and helping teams build apps and online services
          for almost 15 years now.

          My work with product teams centres around the three principles and
          competences, proven to lead to better products and business results.
        </p> -->
        <p>
          That’s why empowered, self-driven product teams are the backbone of
          today's most successful tech businesses.
        </p>

        <p>
          These teams excel at discovery, to continuously uncover new
          opportunities and more effective solutions. They experiment rapidly,
          to minimise risks and costs while learning how to maximise impact. And
          their members collaborate creatively, to push themselves and each
          others’ ideas further than anyone would have known to ask for.
        </p>

        <p>These are the teams I love to help product companies build.</p>
