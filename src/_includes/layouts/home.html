          For tech-driven product companies, the pressure to perform is huge.
          The breakneck speed at which technology, customer expectations and new
          competition evolve means only the most agile and fast learning
          companies are able to adapt and survive long term.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s why empowered, self-driven product teams are the backbone of
          today's most successful tech businesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          These teams
          <span class="text-gradient">excel at discovery</span>, to continuously
          uncover new opportunities and more effective solutions. They
          <span class="text-gradient">experiment rapidly</span>, to minimise
          risks and costs while learning how to maximise impact. And their
          members <span class="text-gradient">collaborate creatively</span>, to
          push themselves and each others’ ideas further than anyone would have
          known to ask for.

      There is no “one right way” to build great products. There are a number of
      key principles though, that are shared across high-performing cultures and
      teams. All my work with teams revolves around putting these principles
      into practise, in ways that fit the characters and cultures of the team
      and company.
