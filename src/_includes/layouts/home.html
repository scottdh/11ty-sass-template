          I work with startups and other tech-driven product companies to help
          build the high performing cultures and empowered product teams that
          are the backbone of today's most successful tech businesses.

        <p>
          Thanks to these self-driven teams of designers, engineers and product
          managers, their companies are able to consistently find new and better
          ways to delight customers with products they love, by effectively
          solving problems they care about.
        </p>
        <p>
          They achieve this by
          <span class="text-gradient">excelling at discovery</span>, to uncover
          more valuable opportunities and better solutions. They
          <span class="text-gradient">experiment rapidly</span>, to minimise
          development risks and maximise the impact on business objectives. And
          their members
          <span class="text-gradient">collaborate creatively</span>, to push
          themselves and each others’ ideas further..

          I’ll help you create a strong, shared understanding of exactly what
          your product does now, and is envisioned to do later, getting everyone
          on the same page. We’ll do this by mapping your product in a way
          everyone can understand, gathering insights and candidly assessing
          product performance to identify the biggest value next steps. By
          prioritising tasks and outcomes, not solutions and outputs, your teams
          can work smarter and more autonomously, while collectively moving
          towards something increasingly spectacular.

          I’ll work with teams to build a rapid, repeatable process of product
          discovery and learning, to continually uncover customer needs and
          valuable opportunities, while rooting out assumptions and blindspots
          that help us minimise risks and avoid costly missteps. This same
          process will also enable us to test our ideas, to get more right more
          often, maximising impact on business goals. Done right, it’s perhaps
          the most effective way to improve product value, quality and long term
          innovation.
