          For tech-driven product companies, the pressure's always on.
          Technology, customer expectations and new competition evolve at
          breakneck speeds, meaning only the most agile and fast learning
          companies are able to survive long term.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s why empowered, self-driven product teams are the backbone of
          today's most successful tech businesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          These teams
          <strong>excel at discovery</strong>, to continuously uncover new
          opportunities and more effective solutions. They
          <strong>experiment rapidly</strong>, to minimise risks and costs while
          learning how to maximise impact. And their members
          <strong>collaborate creatively</strong>, to push themselves and each
          others’ ideas further than anyone would have known to ask for.
