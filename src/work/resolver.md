Resolver is a UK based business, dedicated to improving the world of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), and championing better outcomes for consumers.

Their latest product offering is Accord, a SaaS Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) platform, aimed at ADR organisations all over the world. These organisations bring disputing parties together, to help them find amicable resolutions to their disputes without involving messy and expensive court proceedings.

Accord's progress was hindered by organisational changes and a lack of product design experience at the company. Turning their expertise and knowledge of the ADR world into a product that many providers would want to buy was a completely new challenge for them.
